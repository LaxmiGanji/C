## Brick Breaker Game

### About
This is a video game that is inspired by the BlackBerry game Brick Breaker. I wrote this application in C++.

### Instructions
The game gives the user control of the paddle which is used to reflect the ball towards a large collection of bricks and destroying all of them in order to win complete the game.

| Key     | Action    |
| :------------- | :----------: |
|  Right Arrow Key | Moves Paddle to the Right.   | 
| Left Arrow Key   | Moves Paddle to the Left. | 
| Space Bar | Launches the Ball |

#### Bricks
* Red Bricks: This is the strongest Brick and takes three hits to destroy the brick.
* Blue Bricks: This is the middle level Brick and it takes two hits to destroy this brick. 
* Green Bricks: This is the weakest group of bricks and only takes one hit to destroy this brick. 

#### Lives
* The player has 3 Lives.
* These 3 lives are transferred within all of the levels and must be used to complete all 4 levels of the game.

## Snake Game

### About
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game in C. The objective of the game is to control the snake and eat as many apples as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

### Instructions
* Use the arrow keys to control the movement of the snake.
* The snake will move in the direction of the arrow key pressed. 
* The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.

### Features
This implementation of the Snake game includes additional features such as a score counter and a game over screen. The code has been optimized for better performance and readability.
Feel free to use this code in your own projects or modify it to suit your needs.
Happy gaming!
